# Epidemic System ü¶†

This repository contains the source code of Integrative Task 2, which consists of developing an application that models the cities and routes of Valle del Cauca, which are being affected by an epidemic and the problem to solve is to evacuate as many people as possible, taking into account the available quantity of medical supplies.  We do this by applying graph theory and making use of algorithms such as BFS, Dijkstra and Kruskal.
